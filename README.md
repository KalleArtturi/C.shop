## 🎮 About This Repo

After years of high-level languages holding my hand, and some didling with C. I've decided to  Actually venture into the dangerous streets of C programming. Memory management? Manual allocation? **Segmentation faults?** 

NOTE!

In case you are a current of future employer i suggest not to venture deeper to this repo since it will display only my self taught know how of basic C.

Please!
Thank you!
